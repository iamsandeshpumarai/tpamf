The Late Tanka Prasad Acharya and his friends braved the vicious reign of the Ranas of Nepal in the 1930s for a democratic regime. Four of his friends became martyrs in this effort. He was spared by the Ranas form death sentence because he was a Brahmin, and killing a Brahmin was a big sin in the eyes of the Ranas. They pitched into the battle with the Ranas in order to bring democracy and justice to the people of Nepal. His ideals were democracy and individual and social justice, a Nepal where all the citizen have the right to choose whatever form of government they want and where everybody was treated equal.","Since its establishment in 1993, the Foundation has evolved into a research and advocacy forum for leaders of various socio-political convictions for discussions on issues of national importance.
